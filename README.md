<!-- <h2 align="center"><a href="#">&#x200B;</a>âœ¨About Meâœ¨</h2>

<h2 align="center"><a href="#">&#x200B;</a>Skills & Strengths</h2>
<details>
<summary align="center"><h3><a href="#">&#x200B;</a>Always Learning</h3></summary>
<p>I enjoy problem solving and I'm a fast learner. Most of the time when I come back to a project after some time and read my old code, I'm shocked by how different the code is compared to how I would write it now. I'm very passionate about software development and have so many ideas for projects that I want to work on. I'm a hands on learner, so I learn best by doing. I have a wide variety of projects on my portfolio (nicc.io) and even more on my GitHub (@AcidicNic).</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary align="center"><h3><a href="#">&#x200B;</a>Working with others</h3></summary>
<p>I genuinely love writing code. I get a lot of satisfaction and joy from overcoming roadblocks, trying new things, and discussing code and ideas with other engineers and people in more creative roles. I'm laid back and easy to get along with, "chill" is how most people describe me haha. While most of my experience has been working alone, I really enjoy working with others! I always have a good time bouncing ideas off of people. I take criticism well, I don't really take it personally or get defensive. I acknowledge that I don't know everything and there's always ways to improve. I like getting feedback and using it to grow and improve my skills. There's so much value in working with a group of people who all have different perspectives, skills, and backgrounds.</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary align="center"><h3><a href="#">&#x200B;</a>Jack of All Trades</h3></summary>
<p>I like to be organized. I write solid readme's, documentation, and comments. I like to look into best practices and lint my code. My professional experience includes backend development, some frontend (android and web), developing and using APIs, database management & structure, and a variety of odd jobs like crypto and AI stuff. Outside of the things I am very comfortable with, I consider myself to be a jack of all trades. I like to change things up and try things outside of my comfort zone, so I've picked up an assortment of skills over the years:
<ul> <li> Arduino/hardware, DNS & domain management, technical writing (articles, tutorials, documentation), cloud platforms (like AWS), git, GitHub, vim, linux, bash, making browser games with Node.js or React, websockets, Ethereum smart contracts, HTTP protocols, data modeling, photoshop</li></ul></p>

<h2 align="center"><a href="#">&#x200B;</a>Passions & Values</h2>
<details>
  <summary align="center"><h3><a href="#">&#x200B;</a>Diversity and Inclusion</h3></summary>

  <p>I like to have appreciation for, acceptance of, and understanding of people who are different from me. Being a hispanic immigrant and a lesbian in an industry filled with men, I've come to appreciate and understand the need for safe spaces for underrepresented communities like women, LGBTQ+, and BIPOC (black, indigenous, people of color). It's very important to make sure people in these communities are respected, given a voice, and have a space to talk about their experiences with people who understand them.</p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary align="center"><h3><a href="#">&#x200B;</a>Being a Queer Woman in Tech</h3></summary>

  <p>Out of about 300 student in my college's Applied Computer Science program, there was under 20 women. I've been the only women in a CS class many times, including the first ever computer science class that I took back in 9th grade. I break a lot of people's expectations. I've spent my whole life feeling like I need to prove myself to others. I've come across people who underestimated my technical skills or knowledge on a topic upon first meeting me, but I typically gain their respect after talking to them for a bit because they realize that I know what I'm talking about. I've been in classes where on the first day someone speaks to me in a patronizing way and assumes I don't know anything, but a couple weeks later they're asking me for help or inviting me to work on a project with them.</p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary align="center"><h3><a href="#">&#x200B;</a>Other Passions & Hobbies</h3></summary>

  <p>I'm passionate about activism, human rights, and sustainability. As well as an empathetic evidence-based harm reduction approach to substance abuse and addiction. I'm certified by the Red Cross in First Aid for Opioid Overdoses and I always carry Narcan (a nasal spray that temporarily reverses opioid overdoses) with me. I plan on getting First Aid and CPR certifications from the Red Cross as well.</p>

  <p>I'm proud to have been born in Uruguay. A country that legalized gay marriage, abortion, and recreational cannabis all at once time back in 2013. Two years before the United States federally legalized gay marriage.</p>

  <p>Besides than writing code, I like video games, drawing, making jewelry, listening to music, going to concerts, and hiking.</p>

<h2 align="center">Background & Education</h2>

<details>
  <summary align="center"><h3><a href="#">&#x200B;</a>Childhood Inspiration</h3></summary>
  
  <p>I was born in Uruguay and came to America with my mom when I was only 3 years old. My mom was and still is a software developer, a few years ago she finally got her dream job. She's always been an inspiration to me. She raised me to be bilingual and never let me forget how to speak Spanish. She helped me find my passion and has always been very supportive. She even has ADHD just like me, despite that she's smart and dedicated. She's living proof that I don't have to limit myself based on other people's expectations of me.</p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary align="center"><h3><a href="#">&#x200B;</a>High School & Community College</h3></summary>
  
  <p>School was really hard for me, until I found computer science. I have ADHD and was unmedicated up until the age of 19. I struggled a lot and would often do my work either,  in class immediately after it was assigned, or at the last minute when the wave of "oh shit, i have to turn this in really soon" adrenaline hit me. I did good on tests because I actually did pay attention in class, but I had a hard time completing assignments, especially essays. It didn't help that I moved around a lot throughout my childhood and attended 4 different high schools. I actually never graduated from high school, instead I took the CHSPE (California High School Proficiency Exam). I passed on my first try and continued to attend my local community college, to take classes that were fun and I was actually good at, like math and computer science courses. The difference was night and day. It wasn't a struggle to do my work anymore. I didn't have to force myself to get through it, because I was actually looking forward to doing my homework. I always went go above and beyond on my programming assignments, to challenge myself. I went out of my way to learn and do more by researching topics outside of the class and the textbook. I learned how to learn. It's different for everyone and I had finally found a strategy that worked for me.</p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary align="center"><h3><a href="#">&#x200B;</a>Unconventional College Experience</h3></summary>
  
  <p>I eventually applied to a new computer science college in San Francisco, called Make School. They were in the process of getting accredited and I would have gotten an actual Bachelors from them. They were being accredited though another college, Dominican University of California. Due to financial issues, <a href="https://www.dominican.edu/news/news-listing/dominican-welcomes-new-continuing-applied-computer-science-students">Dominican University absorbed Make School</a>], making it their Applied Computer Science program. This happened It's still the same program even with a lot of the same professors, but now instead of having their own building in San Francisco, the classes take place on online or on Dominican's campus in San Rafael.</p>

  <p>This college was the best thing that ever happened to me. I really flourished and became a more confident & skilled developer during my time there. I really worked on myself during this time. I went to therapy, found ways to work with my ADHD, and figured out how to discipline & motivate myself.</p>

  <p>Unlike the CS community college classes I took before, Make School taught us practical and up-to-date tech tools & skills, everything was project based, and we were always encouraged self-learn and to keep learning outside of class. We were encouraged to ask questions, have discussions, do our own research, be creative, work on personal projects, read documentation, and go beyond assignment requirements to challenge and improve ourselves. The professors were passionate, smart, and talented software engineers who I looked up to a lot. They were supportive, gave great advice, and unlike the student population, half of them were women. The classes were small and intimate. There was a variety of courses to choose from, about backend web, frontend web, mobile, data science, machine learning, and even crypto. I learned about: 
  
  <ul><li>GitHub, making websites, making APIs, databases, cloud services, data structures, sorting algorithms, hosting, domains, writing technical articles, preparing for interviews, job search, using Docker, making Python & npm packages, using libraries & APIs, working in teams, and so much more!</li></ul></p>

  <p>I got to live in San Francisco by Chinatown and walk to my school by Union Square everyday for almost 2 years. The people there were great too, I made lifelong friends at Make School. The school had a very welcoming and cozy atmosphere. It sort of felt like a startup. It wasn't the traditional college experience, but I wouldn't change a thing. It was the perfect fit for me. I found my home, my people, and myself there.</p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary align="center"><h3><a href="#">&#x200B;</a>Where I'm at Now</h3></summary>

  <p>I'm still missing one general ed course, philosophy. I put this on the back-burner and have been working for the last couple years. Finding full time work is currently my main priority, but getting my bachelors is very important to me as well. I'm planning on taking the last course I need online next semester in Spring of 2024. Then I'll finally have my degree! It's been years since I completed all of the other courses I needed and even extra CS classes just for fun. So despite not officially having the degree, it kinda feels like I already have it. It's been a long road filled with challenges and so much growth, but I'm in the home stretch. I just need to take that class.</p>

  <p>I still like to learn things and take courses. I use LinkedIn Learning quite a bit and I enjoy reading Medium articles written by other software engineers.</p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary align="center"><h3><a href="#">&#x200B;</a>Future Plans</h3></summary>
  <p>I'd like to go back too school at some point and work on getting a masters. Maybe even study a different field, that would blend well with my computer science skills. But that probably wont be for a while, as I'm trying to build a more solid foundation for myself first.</p>
